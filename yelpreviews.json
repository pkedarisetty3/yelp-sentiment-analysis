      "My friend and I came here on the first day of their liquor license to get the spiked freezie with 2 free tacos deal. It was packed with people coming with the same idea. The service we experienced exceeded my expectations greatly. After ordering our freezies, we accidentally dropped one on the ground which was entirely our fault. Afterwords, someone who looked like a manager came out to tell us it was alright and to clean up the mess. Another person who looked like a manager came out to give us another freezie for free and even two more free tacos. Even though we felt bad about the accident, they ensured us it was not a big deal. I would definitely come again.",

    "review": "It's a Taco Bell. It is exactly what you expect to get, which is mediocre fast food tacos. The only upside specific to this location is that it is fairly nice and modern on the inside   Also, it was clean and the staff was friendly enough. I obviously only recommend coming here if you work or go to school in the area and you're looking for a lunch that's filling and costs less than $10.",

    "review": "This Taco Bell is probably the nicest looking Taco Bell I have ever been to. It was supposed to be one of the cantinas, but they didn't have a liquor license when I went, so at the time they were just like any other Taco Bell. Lots of seating, TVs along the wall, and very friendly staff made the experience better than most branches. The food was about the same as what you would get anywhere else, but it was a much nicer eating experience.",
